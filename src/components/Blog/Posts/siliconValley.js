        "I lived in San Jose California – the heart of Silicon Valley – on and off for 2 years (the longest about 6 months at a time). The Bay Area is an amazing place - essentially a string of cities all merged into one another stretching around the San Francisco Bay. With a population of over 7.5 million, glorious weather, and iconic surroundings – of both the urban and natural type – you really get this sense of being at the centre of *something*. And it is certainly the centre of the tech world, for which it has long been famous for. ‘Silicon Valley’ – or more accurately, Santa Clara Valley – stretches from San Jose to Redwood City, just short of San Francisco - though the definition is blurred somewhat considering San Francisco is just as much a part of “Silicon Valley”. While San Jose is by far the biggest city in Silicon Valley (even bigger than San Francisco), some of the smaller cities like Palo Alto are equally impressive and important. Everywhere you go, the presence of ‘tech’ is strongly felt – whether it is the developers you are talking to in the coffee shops, the giant headquarters of famous tech companies towering over you, or the driverless-vehicles and robot dogs passing you by on the street.

However, I did spend a day or two driving throughout Silicon Valley visiting some of the most famous sites and I’m sharing some highlights of that here today! First up is San Jose itself. ",

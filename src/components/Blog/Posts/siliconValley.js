        "I lived in San Jose California – the heart of Silicon Valley – on and off for 2 years (the longest about 6 months at a time). The Bay Area is an amazing place - essentially a string of cities all merged into one another stretching around the San Francisco Bay. With a population of over 7.5 million, glorious weather, and iconic surroundings – of both the urban and natural type – you really get this sense of being at the centre of *something*. And it is certainly the centre of the tech world, for which it has long been famous for. ‘Silicon Valley’ – or more accurately, Santa Clara Valley – stretches from San Jose to Redwood City, just short of San Francisco - though the definition is blurred somewhat considering San Francisco is just as much a part of “Silicon Valley”. While San Jose is by far the biggest city in Silicon Valley (even bigger than San Francisco), some of the smaller cities like Palo Alto are equally impressive and important. Everywhere you go, the presence of ‘tech’ is strongly felt – whether it is the developers you are talking to in the coffee shops, the giant headquarters of famous tech companies towering over you, or the driverless-vehicles and robot dogs passing you by on the street.

        "There are literally hundreds – if not thousands – of tech companies based in the Bay Area and I barely scratched the surface. However, I did spend a day or two driving throughout Silicon Valley visiting some of the most famous sites and I’m sharing some highlights of that here today! Like I said, I was based in San Jose where there were lots of famous HQs, including Paypal, Ebay, Adobe and Netflix. To be honest there's not much to do at these places other than get a quick snap outside. Plus San Jose is enormous and the companies are quite spread out, with Paypal in the North and Netflix in the South. San Jose blurs into Santa Clara, where there are other big companies like Microsoft and Intel, as well as a really nice University. Cupertino, which is beside Santa Clara, is famous for the Apple HQ. I didn't visit Apple because the new HQ was under construction while I was in the area, although I did visit 'Steve Jobs Garage' in Los Altos - the legendary childhood home where he supposedly started Apple with Steve Wozniak. I must say I sensed a growing anti-tech sentiment in the South Bay (San Jose/Santa Clara/Cupertino area), where the large working and middle class populations were feeling squeezed out as a result of these corporations - and the influx of their workers to the area - bought up vaste swathes of land and property, pricing the locals out.",

        "Moving North into Mountain View is where things start to get really interesting. Mountain View is where the pioneering Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory became the first high technology company in the area during the 1950s. While the building no longer stands, there are some interesting plaques, memorials and street furniture that mark its significance. Nearby is the famous GooglePlex - a sprawling campus that is absolutely enormous, with it's employees zipping from building to building via the famous colourful bicycles that litter the area. There's lots to see and do there, including a neat gift shop with all kinds of cool google-related merch, random Android statues, a giant T-rex skeleton, the cars they take streetview photos with, organic gardens, quirky busts of celebrities and scientists, and a volleyball court! Mountain View also has the HQ for Tesla as well as NASA's Ames Research Center which were cool to see (the latter had a neat museum).",

    "text5":"Next we move into Palo Alto, which for some reason felt like the very heart of Silicon Valley to me. I thought it was a very beautiful town, and even those with no interest in tech whatsoever would enjoy walking around Stanford University, with it's incredible architecture and tree-lined avenues (I highly recommend the free tour!). Walking down Palo Alto's main street - University Avenue - you pass a seemingly insignificant office (at number 165) that at one point or another housed Logitech, Goolge, Paypal, ebAy and others. Nearby is the famous Hewlett Packard garage - the birthplace of Silicon Valley (according to the sign!). I was told that William Hewlett and David Packard had their major breakthrough just weaks after their fed-up wives had threatened them with divorce! Another cool thing I stumbled upon in Palo Alto was a statue of Nicola Tesla that  was fitted with free wifi!",
    "text6":"Ok, we're coming close to the end of our tour! There are plenty of honourable mentions I could give - such as the Twitter HQ in San Francisco - but I think I'll finish up with Facebook HQ in Menlo Park. This is another sprawling campus, and if I'm honest there isn't much to do there. However, the sign at it's main entrance is a bit of a touristy gimmick and I'm slighly embarassed to say I queued up to get my photo taken beside it 'thumbs up'. One thing I thought was cool though, was the reverse of the sign shows 'Sun Microsystems' - Facebook having taken over Sun Microsystem's old campus and leaving a little of it's legacy behind. Sun Microsystems played a leading role in the development of Javascript, and as a React fan, I thought it was cool that Facebook had taken over the sign - a good reminder of the cycle of tech companies in Silicon Valley.",
